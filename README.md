### Machine Learning
* Ham and Spam Emails : Machine Learning project to predict whether the emails are hams or spams.
• Used supervised learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, SVMs, Logistics Regression and LSTM. 
• The final model predicted whether an email is ham or spam with 99.5% accuracy.

* Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML: Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
* Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments: Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
* Reinforcement Learning: Training a Smartcab to Drive: Creating an optimized Q-Learning driving agent that will navigate a Smartcab through its environment towards a goal.
* Deep Learning: Digit Sequence Recognition using CNNs: Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to recognize sequences of digits using synthetic data generated by concatenating images from MNIST.
